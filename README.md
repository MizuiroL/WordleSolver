# WordleSolver
Given a 5 letter word and the corresponding Wordle output the program filter its dictionary until the word is found. It should work 100% of the time if it's one of its dictionary word. The code needs to be cleaned.

# Stuff to do
- Dictionary file path should be relative and not absolute
- Decoupling the different responsabilities in different classes (access the dictionary, writing the regular expressions, receiving input from console)
- If possible I want to have a single regex for an entire word
